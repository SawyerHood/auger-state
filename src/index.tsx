// This function is a function that will be triggered when a node in the
// subscriber tree updates
type Subscription = () => void;

/*
SubscriberNode is the type that makes the AugerStore work. Most app states
end up being large, nested JS objects, which can be thought of as trees.

Imagine that we have an application state that looks something like this:

```
type State = {
  counter: {value: number};
  user: {name: string; age: string};
};
```

This could be visualized as a tree like so:

state
├── counter
│   └── value
└── user
    ├── name
    └── age

In this example, each line is a different subscriber node with a set of all
of callbacks to be called when the node updates and a list of all children.

AugerStore uses immer to update the state which means that we know the actual
subset of state was changed and we only have to subscribers listening to those
subtrees.

Imagine that I update the state like so:

```
store.update(state => {
  state.user.age++
})
```

In this case we only have to notify subscribers that were listening above the path
that was updated. In the figure below nodes that had there subscription triggered are
denoted with an '*'.

*state
├── counter
│   └── value
└── *user
    ├── name
    └── *age

Note that anything listening to the root or user have to be notified because they will
end up with new object references after this update. All of the parts of the state that
aren't updated (ex the user name and the counter) won't have their subscribers notified!

One thing to note, if you set a property that has children ALL of the children have to
be notified recursively. Ex if we do this:

```
store.update(state => {
  state.user = {name: 'Sawyer', age: 26}
})
```

We now have to update all listeners down stream of user:

*state
├── counter
│   └── value
└── *user
    ├── *name
    └── *age
